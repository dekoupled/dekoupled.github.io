This year I had the goal of getting more active and try to participate in more conferences/meetups.

When [Droicon Lisbon 2023](https://www.lisbon.droidcon.com/){:target="_blank"} announced the call for speakers it was 
the perfect opportunity to iterate on my talk 
[Coupling and Cohesion, How to keep a healthy balance](../gdg-volvo-coupling-cohesion) and get deeper into the details 
of the _**Use Case Driven Architecture**_ used at [Volvo Cars](https://www.volvocars.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

Talking in [Droicon Lisbon 2023](https://www.lisbon.droidcon.com/){:target="_blank"} was a great experience. Fun, full 
of good talks, great organization and the city and weather could have not been better (who doesn't like some sun in late 
September?). I am looking forward for Droidcon Lisbon 2024! 

A video of the talk is on the way, but meanwhile you can entertain yourself with the keynote presentation from the 
[downloads section](#-downloads) or with the [pictures of the event](#pictures-of-the-event).

## Coupling and Cohesion, a recipe for keeping your code healthy

### Abstract
Clean Architecture is increasingly adopted in the industry based on the well-known SOLID principles, 
yet there are two concepts even more basic than SOLID, and SOLID are a way to reach them: coupling and cohesion.

In this talk, Juan will introduce a functional approach to Clean Architecture based on the Interface Segregation 
Principle together with a set of techniques to keep your code loosely coupled and highly cohesive, going from 
the high level definition of a layered architecture to the actual implementation in the code base taking advantages 
of Kotlin functional capabilities.
