# Coupling and Cohesion, a recipe for keeping your code healthy

Clean Architecture is increasingly adopted in the industry based on the well-known SOLID principles, 
yet there are two concepts even more basic than SOLID, and SOLID are a way to reach them: coupling and cohesion.

In this talk, Juan will introduce a functional approach to Clean Architecture based on the Interface Segregation 
Principle together with a set of techniques to keep your code loosely coupled and highly cohesive, going from 
the high level definition of a layered architecture to the actual implementation in the code base taking advantages 
of Kotlin functional capabilities.
