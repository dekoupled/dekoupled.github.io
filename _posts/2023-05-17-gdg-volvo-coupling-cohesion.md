It has been a year since my last talk [Functional Thinking is SOLID](../fp-functional-thinking-SOLID).

I really enjoyed that experience and luckily I had a new chance as a speakers at 
[GDG Android Stockholm meetup](https://www.meetup.com/gdg-android-stockholm/events/293123594).

This time I chose a topic that has guided many (if not all) of my design decisions when coding or architecting a solution: 
_Coupling and Cohesion_. These concepts should be clearly understood by any software engineer, but that, unfortunately, 
not always are put into good practice.

Unfortunately there is no video of this talk ðŸ˜¢ but at least you may catch some of the content from the presentation 
in the [downloads section](#-downloads).

Clean Architecture is increasingly adopted in the industry based on the well-known SOLID principles. In this talk, 
we will introduce a functional approach to Clean Architecture focusing on the Interface Segregation principle to 
reach a lousily coupled code based, while keeping it highly cohesive in its implementation
