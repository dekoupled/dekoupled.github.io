# Functional Thinking is SOLID

{% include embed/youtube.html id='fiUFemfV-2E?t=500' %}

As software Engineers, when coding our solutions, no matter what paradigm we apply, readability, maintainability and testability are qualities that we want our code base to have.
Within OOP, SOLID principles are broadly adopted as a path to reach the previously mentioned qualities.

What if we apply Functional Thinking to our OO solutions? This talk will try to show how the Functional Thinking behind your solutions can lead to a SOLID and Clean code base.
