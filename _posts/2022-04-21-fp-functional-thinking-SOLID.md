When I was in University, one of my favourite subjects was _Functional Programing_, I learned a lot from it till the 
point I even became teacher assistant of it and from that point on, _Functional Programming approach_ impacted 
considerably the way I code my solutions. 

Along my career, while working as part of bigger teams and exchanging ideas with my colleagues, I usually found a bit of 
resistance against applying Functional Programing, this was a big surprise for me due to the duality in between _FP_ and
_OOP_ (Object Oriented Programing), but the language was mostly `java` where everything was a _class_ and then it is just
natural that engineers favour _OOP_ over _FP_.

Fortunately, "modern" languages like `kotlin` and `swift` helped into bringing _Functional Programing_ back into the 
picture (at least withing the mobile world).

I was thrilled to have the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and present my talk _**Functional Thinking is SOLID**_ 
at the [Func Prog Sweden meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Func-Prog-Sweden/events/284546377/) 
hosted by [Volvo Cars](https://www.volvocars.com/).

## Functional Thinking is SOLID

{% include embed/youtube.html id='fiUFemfV-2E?t=500' %}

### Abstract

As software Engineers, when coding our solutions, no matter what paradigm we apply, readability, maintainability and
testability are qualities that we want our code base to have.
Within OOP, SOLID principles are broadly adopted as a path to reach the previously mentioned qualities.

What if we apply Functional Thinking to our OO solutions? This talk will try to show how the Functional Thinking behind
your solutions can lead to a SOLID and Clean code base.
