  alt: Functional Thinking is SOLID at Func Prog Sweden
---

When I was in University, one of my favourite subjects was _Functional Programing_, I learned a lot from it and I even 
became teacher assistant on this subject. 

Even when developing in `java`, I always tried to apply a _Functional Programming approach_ when I code my solutions. 

Along my career, while working as part of bigger teams and exchanging ideas with my colleagues, I usually found 
resistance against Functional Programing, this surprised me a bit due to the duality in between _FP_ and
_OOP_ (Object Oriented Programing), but the language was `java` where everything was a _class_ and then it is just
natural that engineers favour _OOP_ over _FP_.

Fortunately, "modern" languages like `kotlin` and `swift` helped into bringing _Functional Programing_ back into the 
picture (at least withing the mobile world). Yet, there is still a bit of resistance out there.

When [Func Prog Sweden](https://www.meetup.com/Func-Prog-Sweden/){:target="_blank"} was looking for a speaker for the 
[meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Func-Prog-Sweden/events/284546377/){:target="_blank"} hosted by 
[Volvo Cars](https://www.volvocars.com/){:target="_blank"} I was thrilled to have the opportunity of sharing my thoughts 
and present my talk _**Functional Thinking is SOLID**_ and then help a bit into making _FP_ more accepted out there.

## Functional Thinking is SOLID

{% include embed/youtube.html id='fiUFemfV-2E?t=500' %}

### Abstract

As software Engineers, when coding our solutions, no matter what paradigm we apply, readability, maintainability and
testability are qualities that we want our code base to have.
Within OOP, SOLID principles are broadly adopted as a path to reach the previously mentioned qualities.

What if we apply Functional Thinking to our OO solutions? This talk will try to show how the Functional Thinking behind
your solutions can lead to a SOLID and Clean code base.
